# CoCo-ST
CoCo-ST operates by taking two ST data sets as inputs: one serving as the reference and another as the target. These ST data sets typically have certain common structures that are usually not the primary foci. The goal is to extract feature representations that emphasize the new and unique structures enriched in the target ST data set.
