## 🔍 Overview
**CoCoST** (Compare-and-Contrast Spatial Transcriptomics) is a computational framework that uncovers both **high-variance** and **low-variance** spatial structures in large-scale spatial omics data using **contrastive learning**.  
It reveals biologically meaningful, subtle niches that conventional high-variance-based methods often overlook.

---

## 🌟 Key Features
- 🧩 **Contrastive spatial domain detection** – identifies both dominant and subtle spatial structures  
- 🧠 **Multi-scale analysis** – supports 2 µm, 8 µm, and 16 µm Visium HD resolutions  
- 🔗 **Cross-sample integration** – corrects batch effects across samples and technologies  
- ⚡ **Scalable** – efficient for datasets with tens of millions of spots  
- 🧬 **Biologically interpretable** – links spatial domains to cell-cell interactions and tumor evolution
