## 🔍 Overview

**CoCoST** (Compare-and-Contrast Spatial Transcriptomics) is a computational framework designed to uncover both **high-variance** and **low-variance** spatial structures in large-scale spatial omics data.  
By leveraging **contrastive learning**, CoCoST disentangles dominant and subtle spatial patterns, revealing biologically meaningful niches that are often overlooked by conventional high-variance methods.

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🧩 **Contrastive spatial domain detection** – captures both dominant and subtle tissue structures  
- 🧠 **Multi-scale analysis** – supports 2 µm, 8 µm, and 16 µm Visium HD resolutions  
- 🔗 **Cross-sample integration** – corrects batch effects across samples and technologies  
- ⚡ **Scalable** – efficient on datasets with tens of millions of spots  
- 🧬 **Biologically interpretable** – links spatial domains to cell–cell interactions and cancer evolution
